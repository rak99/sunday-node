div.d Hey,
+br
div.d We're getting in touch to invite you to join Sunday, on behalf of #{firstName} #{lastName} (#{email}).
+br
div.d Sunday is a weekly paper made up of stories written by the people you care most about.
+br
div.d Each week, you get to write one story, which you can do at any time. On Sunday, you receive a single email with all of your friends' stories, as do they. And that's about it.
+br
div.d If you only want to receive stories from #{firstName}, and don't want to write stories yourself, you don't have to do anything at all.
+br
div.d But if you'd like to sign up fully and write stories, copy the below italics. Then reply to this email, paste in the italics and change them to your own details.
+br
div.d We'll get in touch with every email address that you give us, inviting your friends to read your Sunday stories, and to write stories themselves. We've put the email address for #{firstName} in there but you can take it out if you'd prefer.
+br
div.d.i First name: Barack
div.d.i Last name: Obama
+br
div.d.i Friends' emails
div.d.i #{email}
div.d.i michelle@obama.com
div.d.i malia@obama.com
div.d.i sasha@obama.com
+br
div.d.i (We recommend around 10 emails.)
+br
div.d Lastly &mdash; if you don't want to receive stories from #{firstName}, and want us to take you off Sunday completely, just reply saying ‘NOTHANKS' and we'll delete your email from our system.
+br
+whatisastory
div.d That's about all you need to know, although we've included a couple more bits of information below in case helpful for you.
+br
div.d We hope you enjoy writing and reading stories, and that Sunday adds something to your life!
+br
div.d Yours,
div.d Sunday
